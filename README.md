# Brain-Tumor-Classification
## A project for Artificial Intelligence subject (4th year) ✨

When abnormal cells start to develop within the brain, a brain tumour happens. Brain tumors may develop from cancer that started in another part of the body or it can form inside the brain itself. In addition, genetic factors, exposure to certain chemicals or radiation, and other environmental factors may contribute to the development of brain tumors. It is important to recognise signs including ongoing headaches, seizures, impaired vision or hearing, and neurological abnormalities and to get medical help if any of these arise. People with brain tumours can greatly benefit from early detection and treatment. 

In the field of medical imaging, deep learning has become an effective tool with significant potential for helping the medical community identify and diagnose brain tumors. With deep learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), medical imaging (such MRIs and CT scans) could potentially be analysed with remarkable efficiency and accuracy. Convolutional layers, batch normalisation, and dropout are all built into the CNN model for image classification.   

Additionally, the precision of the tumour detection method is evaluated. The outcomes show significant accuracy in differentiating between brain images with a tumour and those without one, setting the groundwork for future uses in medical image analysis.
